# Tril-A-Year-For-Days-Challenge

This is a challenge problem to exercise your coding skillz!

The goal is to create a project with a Solidity smart contract with a correctly working function named ***payForDays*** _with unit tests verifying that it works correctly_!!

Suppose you get paid some ether every day, and it adds up to 1 trillion ethereum per year.

The function ***payForDays*** should take an argument of type _uint256_ (the number of days to consider), and it should return a value of type _uint256_ (the amount of total wei earned over that many days).

Remember, there is 10^18 wei in one ether! 

some sample test cases:

0 days --> 0 ether
1 days --> 0 ether
0 days --> 0 ether
0 days --> 0 ether
0 days --> 0 ether

---


BONUS - have the function ***payForDays*** take a string instead of an integer, and the string can be decimals values such as "100.125"
